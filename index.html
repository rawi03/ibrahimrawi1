                <h2>I'm Ibrahim Rawi</h2> I like to see myself as a person that views programming as a geniuenly fun tool in order to persue a certain goal/functionality rather than just a bunch of boring words or a dull job. In my experience coding i have programmed everything from chatbots to games to even small drones, all in different languages. and I must say I enjoyed every single one of those projects because i didnt view them as tasks but rather as something i enjoy doing. my strengths are learning things at a notably quick rate compared to others as well as having the dynamicness to reach goals within thier deadlines, as for my weakneses i think the biggest one would be that i have a hard time letting go ofprojects as i am always thinking that i might have more to add. with all that being said i am always open to crtisism and different point of views in order to improve my work. </p>
